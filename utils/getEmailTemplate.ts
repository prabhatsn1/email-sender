    <p>Dear Recruiter,</p>
    <p>I hope you're doing well.</p>
    
    <p>My name is Prabhat Soni, and I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Optum Global Solutions, where I focus on building scalable, high-performance web applications using React (with TypeScript), Azure Function Apps, and cloud-native tools. With hands-on experience in full-stack development and a strong foundation in DevOps and SQL, I've delivered several impactful solutions in the healthcare domain.</p>
    
    <p>Some highlights from my recent work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrated legacy apps to modern React architecture to enhance performance and maintainability.</li>
      <li>Built scalable, cloud-integrated features for the OptumRx Member Portal, improving UX and analytics integration.</li>
      <li>Actively contributed to cross-functional Agile teams, working closely with QA, design, and product stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Outside work, I've also developed side projects like a Google Translator Clone using Next.js 14, Azure, MongoDB, and OpenAI API, and a Zoom 2.0 Clone in React Native.</p>
    
    <p>I'm reaching out to express my interest in potential software engineering roles at ${companyName}, where I can contribute to innovative product development and cloud-scale architecture. I'd love the opportunity to speak further if there's an open position that aligns with my experience.</p>
    
    <p>You'll find my resume attached. Thank you for your time and consideration!</p>
    
    <p>Best regards,<br>Prabhat Soni</p>
